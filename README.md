You may either submit your notebook through the workspace here, or you may work from your local machine and submit through the next page.  Either way assure that your code passes the project [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).  **Please save regularly.**  This project will assure you have mastered the subjects covered in the statistics lessons.
